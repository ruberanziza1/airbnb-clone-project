-QA Engineer/Tester: Ensures the quality of the software by designing and executing test cases, identifying bugs, and verifying that the application meets the specified requirements.

Technology Stack Overview
===============================
•	Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. In this project, Django will be used for building the robust backend, handling URL routing, ORM for database interaction, and potentially for building RESTful APIs.

•	PostgreSQL: An open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL will serve as the primary data store for the project, chosen for its reliability, data integrity features, and ability to handle complex queries, making it suitable for storing user data, property listings, bookings, and more.

•	GraphQL: A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL will be used to create a flexible and efficient API, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

•	React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React will be used for developing the dynamic and interactive frontend of the Airbnb Clone, enabling component-based development and efficient rendering of UI elements.

•	Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Docker will be used to containerize the application components (e.g., Django backend, PostgreSQL database) to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production, simplifying deployment and scaling.

Database Design 
=========================
•	Users: Represents individuals who interact with the platform. 

o	id (Primary Key)
o	username (Unique, for login)
o	email (Unique, for communication)
o	password_hash (Securely stored password)
o	created_at (Timestamp of user creation)

•	Properties: Represents the listings available for booking. 


o	id (Primary Key)
o	host_id (Foreign Key to Users, indicating the property owner)
o	title (Name of the property)
o	description (Detailed description of the property)
o	price_per_night (Cost to book the property for one night)
o	location (Geographical location of the property)

•	Bookings: Represents a reservation made by a user for a property. 

o	id (Primary Key)
o	user_id (Foreign Key to Users, indicating the booker)
o	property_id (Foreign Key to Properties, indicating the booked property)
o	check_in_date (Start date of the booking)
o	check_out_date (End date of the booking)
o	total_price (Calculated total cost of the booking)

•	Reviews: Represents feedback provided by users on properties or hosts. 

o	id (Primary Key)
o	booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings, linking the review to a specific stay)
o	reviewer_id (Foreign Key to Users, indicating who wrote the review)
o	rating (Numerical rating, e.g., 1-5 stars)
o	comment (Textual feedback)

•	Payments: Represents payment transactions related to bookings. 

o	id (Primary Key)
o	booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings, linking the payment to a specific booking)
o	amount (Amount paid)
o	currency (Currency of the payment)
o	status (e.g., 'pending', 'completed', 'failed')
o	transaction_id (Reference from payment gateway)

Relationships:

•	A User can have multiple Properties (one-to-many: Users to Properties).
•	A User can make multiple Bookings (one-to-many: Users to Bookings).
•	A Property can have multiple Bookings (one-to-many: Properties to Bookings).
•	A Booking belongs to one User and one Property (many-to-one: Bookings to Users and Bookings to Properties).
•	A Booking can have one Review (one-to-one: Bookings to Reviews).
•	A Booking can have one Payment (one-to-one: Bookings to Payments).
•	A Review is associated with a specific Booking and a User who wrote it.





 Feature Breakdown
=========================

User Management: This feature encompasses functionalities for user registration, login, profile management, and potentially password reset. It is crucial for allowing users to create accounts, personalize their experience, and securely access the platform's services.

Property Management: This allows hosts to list their properties, including adding details like descriptions, photos, pricing, and availability. This feature is fundamental as it populates the core content of the platform – the listings that users can browse and book.

Booking System: This core feature enables users to search for properties, check availability, select dates, and complete the booking process. It is essential for the primary function of the Airbnb clone, facilitating the reservation of accommodations.

Search and Filtering: This feature provides robust search capabilities, allowing users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, number of guests, and various amenities. It significantly enhances user experience by helping them quickly discover relevant listings.

Review and Rating System: This allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in, and for hosts to review guests. This feature builds trust and transparency within the community, helping future users make informed booking decisions.

Payment Integration: This feature handles the secure processing of payments for bookings. It is vital for enabling financial transactions on the platform, ensuring that hosts receive payments and guests can securely complete their reservations.

API Security
===============================
•	Authentication: This involves verifying the identity of users and applications attempting to access the API. Measures like OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be implemented to ensure that only legitimate users can access their resources and perform authorized actions, protecting user accounts from unauthorized access.

•	Authorization: Once authenticated, authorization determines what specific resources and actions a user is permitted to access or perform. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to ensure that users only have access to the data and functionalities relevant to their role (e.g., a guest cannot modify a host's property listing), thereby preventing unauthorized data manipulation and access to sensitive information.

•	Rate Limiting: This mechanism controls the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a given timeframe. Implementing rate limiting helps to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by slowing down malicious activities and ensuring fair usage of API resources for all users, protecting the stability and availability of the service.

•	Input Validation: All data received from the client will be rigorously validated on the server-side to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This is crucial for protecting the database from malicious code injection and safeguarding user data integrity.

•	Data Encryption (In Transit and At Rest): Sensitive data, such as user credentials and payment information, will be encrypted both when transmitted over the network (using HTTPS/SSL/TLS) and when stored in the database. This ensures that even if data is intercepted or a breach occurs, the information remains unreadable and protected.

•	Secure Error Handling: API error messages will be generic and avoid revealing sensitive internal information (e.g., stack traces, database details) that could be exploited by attackers. This prevents information leakage that could aid in reconnaissance for further attacks.
