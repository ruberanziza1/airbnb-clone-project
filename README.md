1. Team Roles
=================
-Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the entire project lifecycle, managing timelines, resources, and communication with stakeholders. They ensure the project stays on track and meets its objectives.

-Backend Developer: Designs, develops, and maintains the server-side logic, databases, and APIs. Their responsibilities include implementing business logic, handling data storage, and ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

-Frontend Developer: Develops and implements the user interface and user experience of the application. They are responsible for translating design mockups into interactive web pages, ensuring responsiveness and a seamless user experience.

-Database Administrator (DBA): Manages and maintains the project's databases. This includes designing database schemas, ensuring data integrity, performance tuning, backups, and recovery.

-DevOps Engineer: Focuses on bridging the gap between development and operations. Their responsibilities include setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, automating deployments, managing infrastructure, and monitoring system performance.

-QA Engineer/Tester: Ensures the quality of the software by designing and executing test cases, identifying bugs, and verifying that the application meets the specified requirements.

2. Technology Stack Overview
===============================
•	Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. In this project, Django will be used for building the robust backend, handling URL routing, ORM for database interaction, and potentially for building RESTful APIs.

•	PostgreSQL: An open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL will serve as the primary data store for the project, chosen for its reliability, data integrity features, and ability to handle complex queries, making it suitable for storing user data, property listings, bookings, and more.

•	GraphQL: A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL will be used to create a flexible and efficient API, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

•	React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React will be used for developing the dynamic and interactive frontend of the Airbnb Clone, enabling component-based development and efficient rendering of UI elements.

•	Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Docker will be used to containerize the application components (e.g., Django backend, PostgreSQL database) to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production, simplifying deployment and scaling.


 Feature Breakdown
=========================

User Management: This feature encompasses functionalities for user registration, login, profile management, and potentially password reset. It is crucial for allowing users to create accounts, personalize their experience, and securely access the platform's services.

Property Management: This allows hosts to list their properties, including adding details like descriptions, photos, pricing, and availability. This feature is fundamental as it populates the core content of the platform – the listings that users can browse and book.
